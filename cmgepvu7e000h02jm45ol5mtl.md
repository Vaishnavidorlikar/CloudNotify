A concise, practical blog covering core Bash topics you’ll use every day: getting started, shebangs, navigation, file listing, cat, grep, aliases, jobs/processes, redirection, and control structures. Each section gives a definition, a clear working explanation, copy‑ready examples, and hands‑on exercises you can run immediately.

### Getting started with Bash

Definition  
Bash is a command‑line shell and scripting language that interprets user commands and executes shell scripts.

Working explanation  
Open a terminal to run interactive commands or create plain‑text scripts. Make scripts executable with `chmod +x` and run them directly (`./`[`script.sh`](http://script.sh)) or via an interpreter (`bash` [`script.sh`](http://script.sh)). Bash reads configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`) that set environment, aliases, and functions.

Quick examples

* Show current directory: `pwd`
    
* Print text: `echo "Hello, world"`
    
* Run a script: `chmod +x` [`hello.sh`](http://hello.sh)`; ./`[`hello.sh`](http://hello.sh)
    

Exercises

* Run `pwd`, `whoami`, `date` in your terminal.
    
* Create [`hello.sh`](http://hello.sh) containing `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `echo "Hello, <your-name>"`; make it executable and run it.
    
* Write a one‑line script showing system uptime: `echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"`.

### Script shebang

Definition  
The shebang is the first line in a script that tells the system which interpreter to use, e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

Working explanation  
Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for portability so the script uses the first `bash` in the user’s PATH. Shebang only matters when the script is executed directly; calling `bash` [`script.sh`](http://script.sh) ignores it.

Examples

* Portable header: #!/usr/bin/env bash echo "Running under Bash"
    
* Difference: `#!/bin/sh` uses the system shell which may be `dash` (POSIX‑only), not Bash.
    

Exercises

* Create two scripts, one with `#!/bin/sh` and one with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. Test `[[ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]] && echo "Bash"` inside each and observe results.

### Navigating directories

Definition  
Commands and techniques to move through and manage the filesystem from the shell.

Working explanation  
`cd` changes the current directory. `pwd` prints it. `pushd`/`popd` manage a stack of directories for easy switching. Use `mkdir -p` to create nested directories.

Examples

* `cd ~` or `cd` → home
    
* `cd -` → previous directory
    
* `pushd /tmp; popd` → push/pop directory stack
    
* `mkdir -p proj/{src,bin,doc}` → create nested structure
    

Exercises

* Create `project/{src,bin,doc}` and `cd` into `src`.
    
* Use `pushd` to switch to `/tmp` and `popd` to return; print `dirs`.
    
* Write a script that makes `~/backup/$(date +%Y%m%d)` and copies a file into it.

### Listing Files

Definition  
Commands to show files and metadata in directories.

Working explanation  
`ls` lists names; flags add details. `stat` shows low‑level metadata. `find` locates files by criteria; `du` and `df` show disk usage.

Examples

* `ls -la` → long listing including hidden files
    
* `ls -lhS` → human sizes sorted by size
    
* `stat file.txt` → detailed info
    
* `find . -type f -name '*.c'` → find C files recursively
    

Exercises

* List files sorted by modification time: `ls -lt`.
    
* Find all `.log` files modified in last 7 days: `find . -name '*.log' -mtime -7`.
    
* Compare `ls -l` and `stat` output for the same file and explain differences.

### Using cat

Definition  
`cat` concatenates and prints file contents to stdout; useful for quick viewing and file creation.

Working explanation  
`cat file` streams file to terminal; `cat > file` writes stdin to file; `cat file1 file2 > combined` merges files. For large files prefer `less`.

Examples

* `cat file.txt`
    
* `cat -n file.txt` → show line numbers
    
* `cat file1 file2 > merged.txt`
    

Exercises

* Create `todo.txt` with three lines using `cat > todo.txt`.
    
* Append a line with `cat >> todo.txt`.
    
* Concatenate all `.log` files into `all_logs.txt`.
    

---

### Grep

Definition  
`grep` searches text using patterns (regular expressions) and prints matching lines.

Working explanation  
Provide a pattern and files; use options for case‑insensitive search (`-i`), line numbers (`-n`), recursive search (`-r`), counts (`-c`), and inverse match (`-v`). Combine with pipes to filter command output.

Examples

* `grep -n 'TODO' *.c`
    
* `ps aux | grep -i nginx`
    
* `grep -r --exclude-dir=.git 'FIXME' .`
    

Exercises

* Find all lines containing `TODO` in the project: `grep -nR 'TODO' .`.
    
* Count matches of `#include` in `/usr/include`: `grep -R '#include' /usr/include | wc -l`.
    
* Use `grep -v` to remove blank lines: `grep -v '^\s*$' file.txt`.
    

---

### Aliasing

Definition  
Aliases create shortcuts for longer commands or preferred options.

Working explanation  
Define aliases with `alias name='command'`. Put them in `~/.bashrc` to persist. For complex behavior use shell functions instead of aliases.

Examples

* `alias ll='ls -lh --color=auto'`
    
* `alias gs='git status'`
    
* function example for `mkcd`: mkcd() { mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"; }
    

Exercises

* Add `alias la='ls -la'` to `~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bashrc`, test it.
    
* Write a `mkcd` function and add it to `~/.bashrc`; explain why alias alone isn’t sufficient.
    
* Create alias `histg` to run `history | grep`.
    

---

### Jobs and Processes

Definition  
Jobs are processes launched from your shell; process utilities manage running programs and system state.

Working explanation  
Use `&` to background a job. `jobs` lists them. Use `fg`/`bg` to control, `kill` to terminate, and `ps`/`top` for system‑wide process inspection.

Examples

* `sleep 300 &` → background job
    
* `jobs` → list background jobs
    
* `fg %1` → bring job 1 to foreground
    
* `ps aux | grep httpd` → find processes
    

Exercises

* Start `sleep 600 &`, run `jobs`, bring it to foreground with `fg`, stop with Ctrl+C.
    
* Start a Python HTTP server in background: `python3 -m http.server 8000 &`, confirm with `ps`, then kill it.
    
* Write a script that launches three background `sleep` jobs, uses `wait` and prints when all have finished.
    

---

### Redirection

Definition  
Redirects send command stdin/stdout/stderr to files or connect commands via pipes.

Working explanation

* `>` overwrite stdout, `>>` append, `<` read stdin.
    
* `2>` redirects stderr, `&>` redirects both stdout and stderr.
    
* `|` pipes stdout of one command to stdin of another.
    

Examples

* `ls -l > listing.txt`
    
* `grep error logfile 2> errors.txt`
    
* `cmd1 | cmd2 | tee output.txt` → view and save pipeline output
    

Exercises

* Run `ls nonexistent >out.txt 2>err.txt` and inspect both files.
    
* Count unique IPs in `access.log`: `awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head`.
    
* Write script that logs stdout and stderr to `logs/$(date +%F).log` using `&>>` (append).
    

---

### Control Structures

Definition  
Control structures direct the flow of scripts: conditionals, loops, and case switches.

Working explanation  
Use `if`, `case`, `for`, `while`, `until` and functions to implement logic. Prefer `[[ ... ]]` for Bash tests and `(( ... ))` for arithmetic. Quote variables and use `set -euo pipefail` in scripts for safer behavior.

Examples

* If example: if \[\[ -f "$1" \]\]; then echo "File exists" else echo "Missing" fi
    
* For loop: for file in \*.txt; do echo "Processing $file" done
    
* Case menu: case "$opt" in
    
    1. echo "One";;
        
    2. echo "Two";; \*) echo "Invalid";; esac
        

Exercises

* Script that accepts a filename and prints whether it is a file, directory, or missing.
    
* Implement FizzBuzz for 1..100 with a `for` loop.
    
* Write a menu using `case` providing options: list files, print cwd, exit.
    
* Write `backup_file()` function that copies a file to `~/backup/$(date +%Y%m%d)/` and call it for multiple files.

### Mini Projects (combine topics)

1. Log monitor
    
    * Script with shebang that runs `tail -F logfile | grep --line-buffered "ERROR"` and redirects matches to `errors-$(date +%F).log`. Run in background and manage with `jobs`.
        
2. Student CSV processor
    
    * Script reads `students.csv` with `while IFS=, read id name marks; do ...; done`, computes topper, and prints summary. Use functions, redirection, and `sort`.
        
3. Backup and rotate
    
    * Script creates dated backup, copies files, and keeps only last `N` backups using `ls -1d ~/backup/* | tail -n +$((N+1)) | xargs -r rm -rf`.
        

Exercises

* Implement project 1 and test by appending lines to source log.
    
* Implement project 2 with validation and error handling.
    
* Implement project 3 with configurable retention via command‑line argument.

### Practical tips and safety

* Use `set -euo pipefail` and `trap` to handle errors and cleanup in scripts.
    
* Always quote variables: `"$file"`.
    
* Prefer functions over aliases for reusable logic.
    
* Test destructive commands with `echo` before enabling actual execution.
    
* Use `shellcheck` to lint scripts and catch common pitfalls.
